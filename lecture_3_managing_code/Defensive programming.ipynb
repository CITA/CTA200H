Experience has shown that in most projects the majority of development time is spent debugging. For this reason, it is highly desirable to follow practices that minimise the number of bugs. In this notebook I will introduce a number of tried and true methods for avoiding bugs. It does require extra work, but your future self will thank you.\n",

Unfortunately, not only is this a messy way to go about it, after you fix the problem you need to scan the code and remove all the print statements. Luckily, there is a better way - logging.

    "Suppose you have a library that you tested and it is working. One day, you decide to refactor it. Maybe you want to optimise it and make it faster, or add more features. The problem is that whenever you change the code you are running the risk of breaking it. The best tool against this is version control. Version control lets you save multiple versions of your code, and load a previous version in case something breaks. It also lets you [collaborate more effectively](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows). The most popular version control system today is [git](https://git-scm.com/doc?fbclid=IwAR1YxT3x6XCvpcLC1x4HCS7saF5hPAKkfr4t_IMlkk7tu9xN7FwDmgF4TBY), and the most popular repository hosting services are github and bitbucket. Below are the most commonly used commands:\n",
    "* clone - Creates a copy of the repository on your local machine\n",
    "* pull - Changes your local copy such that it would be the same as the one on the server\n",
    "* commit - Records local changes locally\n",
    "* push - Transmit commits to server"

    "In addition, git also provides another set of commands that is especially useful for refactoring. The basic problem here is that between the current state of the code and the state of the code after refactoring, the code might be broken. This can be a problem, since you might also want to use the code in the mean while. The solution is to make two copies of the code, one that is operational, and another which is safe to break. This is called branching. After you are done making changes on the second copy and you are satisfied by the result, you can merge back the two copies of the code. The corresponding command are adequately called \"branch\" and \"merge\". The command \"checkout\" lets you switch between branches."

    "Ideally, you'd like to test the code every time you make a change. However, doing this manually would be extremely tedious. Luckily for us, we can get a computer to do it for us. This practice is called continuous integration. The way it works is that you have a server that listens to the repository, and run a series of tests whenever a commit is pushed. One of the more popular continuous integration tools is Travis CI. Setting up continuous integration would take too long for this tutorial, but you can see an example that I've already set up [here](https://travis-ci.org/bolverk/huji-rich). If nothing else, continuous integration can help you when you argue with your colleagues about who broke the code, as seen in the example below."

After that, you close the compartments, and the machine spins fast (so you can't follow it) and stops at some random orientation.
