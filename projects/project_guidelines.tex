\maketitle


Although there are many different projects, the basic expectations are the same for everyone. First, complete the problems in your project, ideally by writing one or more scripts that produce output.
To submit a completed project, please submit the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  One working script that accomplishes each of the goals outlined in the project. The code should be commented to se
  parate each sub-problem of the project. The code should generate figures in PDF format.
\item One LaTeX file containing:
  \begin{itemize}
\item A brief introduction to the problem you are solving and a description of what your script does.
\item If the project has steps that ask you to explain something, make sure to explain this in the LaTeX file.
\item The LaTeX file should have at least one embedded figure and one labeled equation, which are both referenced to (and linked) in the main text. The figure(s) should have a caption, as well.
\item If the figures you generate need a special package that is not pre- compiled on CITA, please include PDFs of all figures relevant to the project. Any figures produced using the basic libraries (e.g. mat- plotlib) should be generated by the script and not sent with the LaTeX file.
  \end{itemize}
\item Push your code, your .tex file, and a compiled PDF of the report to your Github repository. Send the line to the repository to the instructors as well as your SURP/SURF supervisor if you have one.
\end{enumerate}
