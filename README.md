# CTA200H

Welcome to the CTA200H course!

This course is for summer undergraduates performing research in astrophysics at University of Toronto, including but not limited to participants in UofT's CITA Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) and David A Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). The goal is to provide training to help students be successful with the computation aspects of their summer research program.

## Logistics

The course will run every afternoon from **1:00pm to 5:00p**, from **Monday May 5** to **Thursday May 15**.
This 4-hour block will be split into two hours of lecture followed by two hours of tutorial time, in which students will work on their course homework.

Location: The course will be held hybrid, both in person in MP257 and remotely, via zoom. Access to CITA computers will be done via VNC Remote Desktop or SSH.

# Marking Scheme

The mark will be determined on the basis of three items:

| Item                  | Weight|
| --------------------- | ----- |
|1. Class participation | 10%   |
|2. Homework:           | 40%   |
|3. Project:            | 50%   |

## Homework

In the first week students will work on homework problems related to the first week's lectures.  For the second week they will work on a week-long project that will be closely related to the research they do for the rest of the summer.  They will hand in their results for this project at the end of the course.

The problem set will be divided into three smaller assignments to be handed in every couple of days. 

* [Assignment 1 Due by 1PM May 7th](assignments/assignment_1.md)
* [Assignment 2 Due by 11:59PM May 9th](assignments/assignment_2.pdf)
* [Assignment 3 Due by 1PM May 13th](assignments/assignment_3.pdf)

## Project
In the second week students will work on a project supplied either by their supervisor or the instructor. The project is due by 5PM on Monday May 19th 2025.
