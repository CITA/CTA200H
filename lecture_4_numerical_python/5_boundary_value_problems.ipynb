    "## Boundary value problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last segment we covered the integration of ordinary differential equations from initial conditions specified at one value of the independent variable (initial value problems). Frequently, however, the relevant physics dictate that boundary conditions be applied at more than one value of the independent variable. ODEs present \"two-point boundary value problems\" (BVPs) when boundary (or interface) conditions need to be applied at at least two values of the independent variable. BVPs most commonly involve boundary conditions applied at the beginning and ending values of the integration domain. There are many approaches to solving BVPs, and usually the best one to take depends on the details your problem. \n",

    "### Shooting method\n",
    "\n",
    "Shooting methods build on the machinery for solving IVPs that we've already covered. Generally, an $N$'th order differential equation requires $N$ boundary conditions. If $n_i$ of those are specified at the first boundary $x_i$, then $n_f=N-n_i$ must be applied at the second boundary $n_f$. In a shooting method, we apply $n_i$ boundary conditions and additionally $n_f$ guesses for the remaining conditions at $x_i$. Integrating (\"shooting\") to $x_f$, we then check whether the $n_f$ boundary conditions at $x_f$ are satisfied. If they are not, we adjust our guesses at $x_i$ and start again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration of the ODEs can itself be thought of as a function, where $n_f$ inputs at the initial boundary (our guesses for the unspecified conditions) produce $n_f$ outputs (the degree to which the remaining BCs are satisfied at $x_f$). To solve the BVP, we can therefore apply root-finding algorithms like the Newton-Raphson iteration that we covered a few segments ago. The relevant vector formulation of Newton's method is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    {\\bf J}\\cdot\\delta{\\bf v} = -{\\bf f},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is a vector of $n_f$ deviations from the required boundary conditions at $x_f$, $\\delta{\\bf v}$ is a correction to a vector ${\\bf v}$ of $n_f$ \"guesses\" applied at $x_i$, and ${\\bf J}$ is a Jacobian matrix: $J_{ij}=\\partial f_i/\\partial v_j$. In the case $n_f=1$, this formulation simplifies to the same formula we used for root-finding earlier on.\n",
